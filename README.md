# Web of things 

## About 
This project is all about the web of things. Using a nodeMCU we made a game implementing a game where the user has to gues the color of a word.
Using the nodeMCu as a controller with one button the user has to press the box with the right color on it witinh a vertain amount of time. The longer the user plays the shorter time they have.
